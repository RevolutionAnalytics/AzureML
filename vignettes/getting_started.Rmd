Use this package to upload and download datasets to and from AzureML, to
interrogate experiments, to publish R functions as AzureML web services, and to
run R data through existing web services and retrieve the output.

# Installation instructions

Install the development version of the package directly from GitHub with:

```r
# Install devtools
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RevolutionAnalytics/azureml")
```

The package depends on:

- `jsonlite`
- `curl`
- `miniCRAN`
- `base64enc`
- `uuid`

Some of the examples use data and functions in:

- `lme4`
- `ggplot2`


# Overview

AzureML provides an interface to publish web services on Microsoft Azure
Machine Learning (Azure ML) from your local R environment. The main functions
in the package cover the following topics:

- Workspace: connect to and manage AzureML workspaces
- Datasets: upload and download datasets to and from AzureML workspaces
- Publish: publish R functions as AzureML web services, and update or delete existing services
- Consume: apply any AzureML web service to your R data

## Getting Started

To get started, please navigate to [AzureML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net)
and create a free account (not guest) or use your existing AzureML account.
After logging in, under the "Settings" tab, copy and paste your Workspace ID
from the "Name" sub-tab into your R console. From the "Authorization Tokens"
sub-tab, copy your Primary Authorization Token into your R console. You will
need this information to access all package functionality.

The package defines a `Workspace` class that represents an AzureML work space.
Most of the functions in the package refer to a Workspace object directly or
indirectly. Use the `workspace()` function to create Workspace objects, either
by explicitly specifying an AzureML workspace ID and authorization token.
Workspace objects are simply R environments that actively cache details about
your AzureML sessions.

## Obtaining AzureML Credentials

Before using the package, it is necessary to first obtain the security
credentials to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can find this be
logging in at [https://studio.azureml.net](Azure ML web site). If you do not
have an account, you can create a free account (not guest) to use these APIs.

Once logged in, you will be brought to the Studio landing page. Using the
left-hand menu, navigate to the 'Settings' tab to find your Workspace ID. Note
this, or copy it into your R session and store it is a variable, e.g. myWsID.

<img src="workspaceID.png" width="80%">

Next, within the 'Settings' tab, use the overhead menu to navigate to the
'Authorization Tokens' tab and similarly note your Primary Authorization Token.

<img src="authToken.png" width="80%">

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(AzureML)
ws <- workspace(
  id = "your workspace ID",
  auth = "your authorization token"
)
```

or alternatively create a file in `~/.azureml/settings.json` with the JSON
structure (`api_endpoint` and `management_endpoint` are optional):

```json
{"workspace": {
   "id"                  : "test_id",
   "authorization_token" : "test_token",
   "api_endpoint"        : "api_endpoint",
   "management_endpoint" : "management_endpoint"
}}
```

See `?workspace` for more details.

## Examining workspace datasets, experiments and services

The `datasets()`, `experiments()`, and `services()` functions return data
frames that contain information about those objects available in the workspace.

The package caches R data frame objects describing available datasets,
experiments and services in the workspace environment. That cache can be
refreshed at any time with the `refresh()` function. The data frame objects
make it relatively easy to sort and filter the datasets, experiments, and
services in arbitrary ways.  The functions also include filtering options for
specific and common filters, like looking up something by name.

Use the `download.datasets()` and `upload.dataset()` functions to download or
upload data between R and your Azure workspace. The
`download.intermediate.dataset()` function can download ephemeral data from a
port in an experiment that is not explicitly stored in your Azure workspace.

Use `delete.datasets()` to remove and delete datasets from the workspace.

The `endpoints()` function describes Azure web service endpoints, and works with
supporting help functions like `endpointHelp()`.

The `publishWebService()` function publishes a custom R function as an AzureML
web service, available for use by any client. The `updateWebService()` and
`deleteWebServce()` update or delete existing web services, respectively.

Use the `consume()` function to evaluate an Azure ML web service with
new data uploaded to AzureML from your R environment.

# Examples

Work with the AzureML package begins by defining a workspace object. The
example below uses the configured workspace ID and authorization token in the
`~/.azureml/settings.json` file.  Alternatively specify these settings
explicitly in the `workspace()` function as outlined above. All of the examples
require this step.

```{r}
library(AzureML)
ws <- workspace()
ws
```

## Datasets

AzureML _datasets_ correspond more or less to R data frames. The AzureML
package defines four basic dataset operations: list, upload, download, and
delete.

### List available datasets

The following example illustrates listing available datasets in your workspace.

```{r}
head(datasets(ws))

# Or, equivalently:
head(ws$datasets)
```

The list of datasets is presented as an a R data frame with class `datasets`.
Its print method shows a summary of the datasets, along with all of the
available variables. Use any normal R data frame operation to manipulate the
datasets. For example, to see the "Owner" value of each dataset:

```{r}
ws$datasets$Owner
```

### Downloading datasets

The next example illustrates downloading a specific  dataset named "Airport
Codes Dataset" from AzureML to your R session. This dataset is presented by
AzureML as a "Generic CSV" dataset, and will be parsed by R's `read.table`
function. (Other formats are parsed by an appropriate parser, for example
`read.arff`.) The example illustrates passing additional arguments to the
`read.table` function used to parse the data from AzureML in this case.

```{r}
airports <- download.datasets(ws, name = "Airport Codes Dataset", quote="\"")
head(airports)
```

You can use `download.datasets` to download more than one dataset as a time,
returning the results in a list of data frames.

### Uploading R data frames as AzureML datasets and deleting datasets

Use the `upload.dataset` function to upload R data frames to AzureML.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Remove dataset if it exists, otherwise we get an error on upload
if("Air quality" %in% datasets(ws, filter = "my")$Name){
   delete.datasets(ws, name = "Air quality")
}
```

```{r}
upload.dataset(airquality, ws, name = "Air quality")

# Let's see what we've got:
head(download.datasets(ws, name = "Air quality"))
```

Delete one or more AzureML datasets with `delete.datasets`:

```{r}
delete.datasets(ws, name="Air quality")
```


## Experiments

Use the `experiments` function or simply use the `ws$experiments` data frame
directly to list details about experiments in your AzureML workspace. The
`experiments` function optionally filters experiments by ownership.

```{r}
e <- experiments(ws, filter = "samples")
head(e)
```

The `ws$experiments` object is just an R data frame with class `experiments`.
Its print method shows a summary of the available experiments, but it can
otherwise be manipulated like a normal R data frame.

The list of experiments in your workspace is cached in the workspace
environment.  Use the `refresh` function to explicitly update the cache at any
time, for example:

```{r}
refresh(ws, "experiments")
```


# Web Services

The AzureML package helps you to publish R functions as AzureML web services
that can be consumed anywhere. You can also use the AzureML package to run R
data through an existing web service and collect the output.

## Publishing a Web Service

The `publishWebService` function helps you to publish an R function as an Azure
ML web service. Consider this simple example R function:

```{r train}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Use the function `publishWebService` to publish the `add` function as a
service named "AzureML-vignette-add":

```{r publish}
ws <- workspace()
api <- publishWebService(
  ws,
  fun = add, 
  name = "AzureML-vignette-add",
  inputSchema = list(
    x = "numeric", 
    y = "numeric"
  ), 
  outputSchema = list(
    ans = "numeric"
  )
)
```

The example publishes a function of two scalar numeric arguments, returning a
single numeric scalar output value. Note that we explicitly define the web
service input and output schema in the example. See the examples below for more
flexible ways of defining web services with functions of data frames.

The result of `publishWebService` is an `Endpoint` object, really just an R
data frame with two elements: a list containing the details of the newly
created web service, and a list of the endpoints of the web service. From here,
you can pass the information on to another user, or use the information to use
the web service from R:

```{r access}
class(api)
names(api)
```

The web service created is identical to a web service published through the
Azure Machine Learning Studio. From the response, you can get the Web Service's
URL, API Key and Help Page URL, as shown above. The first two are needed to
make calls to the web service. The latter has the sample code, sample request
and other information for consuming the API from client apps such as mobile and
web applications.

The new web service will show up on the 'Web Services' tab of the Studio
interface, and the service will have a help page for each endpoint, e.g.

```{r help}
helpPageUrl <- api$HelpLocation
helpPageUrl
```

Once published, you can update a web service using the `updateWebService`
or `publishWebService` functions.
The `updateWebService` function really is just an alias for
`publishWebService`, except that the argument `wsid` is compulsory.



```{r update}
api <- updateWebService(
  ws,
  fun = add, 
  name = "AzureML-vignette-add",
  inputSchema = list(
    x = "numeric", 
    y = "numeric"
  ), 
  outputSchema = list(
    ans = "numeric"
  ),
  wsid = api$WorkspaceId   # <<-- Note you must add wsid to update!
)
```

## Discovering Web Services

The discovery functionality in this package allows users to explore and obtain the web services available to their workspace. On the highest level, the user can use their workspace ID and authorization token, both of which were described in the preceding sections, to obtain a list of web services available to that workspace:

```{r webservice}
webservices <- services(ws, name = "AzureML-vignette-add")
```

Then, the web service ID can be used in conjunction with the authorization credentials to obtain a list of endpoints:

```{r endpoints}
ep <- endpoints(ws, webservices[1, ]$Id)
class(ep)
names(ep)
```

The `endpoints` object contains all the information needed to consume a web service.

Alternatively, you can use the `discoverSchema` function to discover the information needed to consume a web service. The function will return all information available on the endpoint help page, including the API location, the input names, and sample input:

```{r discover}
discoverSchema(ep$HelpLocation)
```

## Consuming Web Services

To send data to your newly published web service API for scoring, use the function `consume`:


```{r df}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:5,
  y = 6:10
)
s <- services(ws, name = "AzureML-vignette-add")
s <- tail(s, 1) # use the last published function, in case of duplicate function names
ep <- endpoints(ws, s$Id)
consume(ep, df)
```


Alternatively, the endpoint primary key and API location can be found on the
help page for that specific endpoint, which can be found on Azure Machine
Learning Studio. Using the Help Page URL, you can access sample code to build
clients that can consume this web service in real time to make predictions.

## Deleting a Web Service

To remove a webservice endpoint that you no longer need, use `deleteWebservice`:

```{r delete}
deleteWebService(ws, name = "AzureML-vignette-add")
```
